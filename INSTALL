This website is tested on a Debian Linux machine using the Apache webserver and requires a MySQL database.

It is assumed that Apache is installed and that the reader is familiar with setting up virtual hosts - one called church is recommended for 
this website.

Various Debian php and apache packages need to be loaded.

sudo apt-get install php5
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
sudo apt-get install php5-cli
sudo apt-get install php5-curl
sudo apt-get install php5-ffmpeg
sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt
sudo apt-get install php5-mysql
sudo apt-get install php5-odbc
sudo apt-get install php5-pgsql
sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite
sudo apt-get install php5-suhosin
sudo apt-get install php5-xdebug

See the sql directory for an initial database load.

To run this website needs some PEAR modules.
A script to load the required modules is in the website-setup directory.
