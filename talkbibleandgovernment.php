<h4>The Bible and Government</h4>

<p>
An Address given by Rev Dr Chris Kent at both Morning Services at Christ Church Lye on
Sunday 25th April 2010 - 4th Sunday of Easter
</p>

<p>
Romans 13: 1 - 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Matthew 28: 16 - 20
</p>

<p>
With the General Election looming large, it wouldn't be surprising if we felt somewhat bemused by the media coverage.
There have been manifesto launches followed by arguments over the merits of each party's proposals.
We've heard claims about the dire consequences of one or another party's winning power and a "hung parliament".
Budding prime ministers have been debating key issues.
</p>
<p>
So, who has the right policies in their manifesto? Do we trust them to carry their promises out?
What if we like some of the proposals in a party's manifesto, but object to others? Have the most important issues been addressed,
or have they been sidestepped or ignored?
</p>
<p>
Should we be concentrating on policy details, or should we be giving more attention to electing the sort of people we can trust to govern us wisely and ethically?
Should we bother to vote at all?
</p>

<p>
With so many questions buzzing around, we thought it right to use the available teaching "slots" following Easter to provide a biblical perspective on the process,
in order to help us to decide how we should vote as faithful followers of Christ.
</p>
<p>
A couple of weeks ago, Graham gave us what I think is a really helpful checklist. Based upon the book of the prophet Amos,
it gets us to ask questions about the state of our nation, the types of campaign being carried out by each party, the consequences of policies proposed,
the sort of country we should become, our own perspective when casting our vote.
</p>

<p>
This morning, we're looking at a Bible passage that focuses on issues that complement those addressed by Graham.
I want to cover them through considering four questions: Does government matter? What are the "hallmarks" of good government?
What are my duties towards government? What happens when government goes wrong?
</p>

<p>
Let's look at the first question first. For that, we'll need to go to our first reading, from Romans chapter 13.
</p>
<p>
Does government matter? Some Christians are suspicious of too much involvement with politics, and prefer to stick to what they regard as "spiritual matters",
as opposed to the "worldly" issues essential to government.
Therefore, for them it matters little whether they vote or not, "for our citizenship is in heaven".
</p>
<p>
This also seems to be the attitude of religious groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses, who, as far as I can tell, regard all governments as being under God's judgment,
and tend to opt out of political involvement. However, Romans 13 points in quite a different direction: According to Paul,
 all authority derives from God; government is his idea, and is essential to the ordering of human societies;
 without it there would be chaos. And so in verse 1, he writes: "there is no authority except that which God has established.
 The authorities that exist have been established by God."
 </p>
 <p>
 Paul wasn't thinking here of purely Christian government; there was no such thing in his day.
 He lived under the imperial government of Rome, which although at the time allowed the Jewish religion several privileges,
 it was a pagan government that wasn't always sympathetic to Christians: after all,
 </p>
 <p>
 it was an official of the Roman governing authority who authorised the crucifixion of Jesus, ostensibly, but quite wrongly, for subversion.
 Yet, Paul tells his readers in verse 5 that "it is necessary to submit to the authorities because of conscience."
 I think that implies more than just a passive, and perhaps sullen or resigned, submission.
 Because the whole concept of government derives from God, those of us who are fortunate to live in a democratic society in which governments are elected
 have a Christian duty to vote.
 </p>
 <p>
 In today's Britain, this is more than likely to return a government that follows a secular agenda;
 but that government ultimately derives its authority from God, whether or not it acknowledges this.
 So, government does matter. And it matters that we cast our vote to elect a government whose members are upright and trustworthy,
  and whose policies reflect Christian values as far as possible.
</p>

<p>
It is also right and proper that Christians lobby parliamentary and local government candidates to try to persuade them to respect and preferably
adopt Christian principles. So, on Easter Day, Archbishop Carey and 29 other Christian leaders launched "Westminster 2010: Declaration of Christian Conscience".
This campaign calls upon all parliamentary candidates to pledge that they will "respect, uphold and protect the right of Christians to hold and express
Christian beliefs and act according to Christian conscience".
</p>
<p>
Please pray for the effectiveness of the campaign, and if you get a visit from one of your constituency hopefuls, do urge them to support the Declaration.
</p>
<p>
For some time, many Christians have felt that the authorities have been marginalising the Christian faith, especially through the way recent legislation
has sometimes been interpreted.
The hope is that the Declaration will help bring back Christian principles and values into the centre of public life. Because government matters and it matters that the government is good…
</p>

<p>
This brings me to my second question: What are the "hallmarks" of good government?
</p>
<p>
We shall again refer to Romans chapter 13 for our answers.
Paul sees the one in authority as God's servant. He says this twice in verse 4: once at the beginning and once at the end of the verse.
At first glance, this appears an extraordinary thing for a Christian apostle to say about pagan officials, governors, magistrates and emperors.
How can a non-believer, most likely with alien values and possibly living a dubious lifestyle, be described as God's servant, when he doesn't acknowledge
the lordship of Christ in his life and in his land? But, if we look through the Bible, we can find cases of non-believers being spoken of in similar terms
to Paul's description. For example, in Isaiah chapter 45 verse 1, Yahweh, the LORD, called Cyrus king of Persia "his anointed".
He used him to carry out an important part of his plans, in allowing the return of Jewish exiles to Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
So, as we consider electing members of parliament and local councillors, let's remember that God doesn't only work through Christians to do his will,
though it must be a lot easier for him if his servants acknowledge him and seek to co-operate.
</p>

<p>
Back to Romans 13 and Paul's criteria for good government.
</p>
<p>
The one in authority functions as a servant of God in two overall ways: Firstly, there is the positive role - In verse 4, "he is God’s servant to do you good."
In verse 3, "do what is right and he will commend you."  However, in verse 4, the one in authority also has the duty of "bearing the sword", and acting as "God's
servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer." Those who do wrong are told to "be afraid" of this servant of God.
</p>
<p>
So, according to Paul, the hallmark of good government is twofold: to "do good" to those who do what is right, and to punish wrongdoers.
I would say that this basically describes a system of just and fair laws administered by just and fair people.
</p>
<p>
And it is to finance that just structure that the citizens are to pay their taxes; that includes Christians. I find it interesting that Paul said nothing further about
economic policies, which at times have dominated our election campaign and loom large in the parties' manifestos.
He seems to have stressed justice and the support of what is right more than anything else. Yes, we do live in a more complex world today, but are we so different from
Paul's generation, deep down?
</p>
<p>
Maybe we should examine our electoral priorities in the light of Paul's criteria for good government, and use these criteria as
yardsticks to scrutinise the policies of the competing candidates.
</p>

<p>
Let's now move on to my third question:
</p>
<p>
What are my duties towards government? Paul's answer seems to be very simple: In verse 1, he writes,
"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities". He repeats this in verse 5, telling us that we should submit to the authorities because our conscience
tells us this is right and not just to avoid being "banged up" in jail.
</p>
<p>
According to verses 6 and 7, this will involve us in paying our taxes and other dues, and not getting involved in dishonest tax avoidance schemes.
And we should also be respectful to those who hold office. Paul doesn't qualify this by advising Christians to respect officials only if they are honest.
God-fearing people. Even if one in authority is a notorious evil-liver, Christians are to respect the office and therefore respect the one in office,
so long as they are there legitimately. So, according to Paul's advice,
Christians should be exemplary in keeping the law, because that ultimately shows respect for  God who is behind government.
</p>

<p>
But - and here is my final question:
</p>
<p>
What if that law is bad, unjust, repressive or immoral?
What happens when government goes wrong? In New Testament times and later, Roman emperors were often addressed as gods, and people were expected to sacrifice to them.
Was that a Christian duty, too, to obey such a law?
</p>
<p>
In more recent times, there have been regimes that have claimed ultimate authority, in the place of God.
In North Korea, for example, the cults of its leader Kim Jong-il and of his father Kim il-Sung seem to have given these two gentlemen near-divine status.
Other countries have passed laws that discriminate against Christians and other religious minorities, or that pressurise them to do things against their consciences,
such as involvement in carrying out abortions.
</p>
<p>
Even in the UK, concern has been expressed by many Christians, including the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the General Synod about the marginalising and
restriction of the Christian faith in public life.
</p>
<p>
Interpretations of recent "equality" regulations and laws have added to that sense. So, are Christians bound to submit to the state unquestioningly and keep all
laws and just do what they're told like the rest of the common people? For guidance on that, we must leave Romans and briefly refer to Acts chapter 5,
where Peter and John were up in front of the Jewish religious authorities, the Sanhedrin, a second time for healing a lame man in the Name of Jesus.
The court ordered them to stop speaking about Jesus. So, should they obey the authorities like good citizens? Peter's answer is as good as I think it gets:
"We must obey God rather than men." When faced by unjust or immoral laws, that is an answer Christians could well consider making, but must be prepared to face
the consequences.
</p>
<p>
So, in a fallen world, I would summarise the Christian's position in the state as being critically supportive of government, but all the time
under the lordship of Christ. For, as Jesus told his disciples, in his Great Commission, in Matthew chapter 28,
"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." And, as the book of Revelation shows, all governments that oppose him will ultimately fall.
For example, Rome was probably the "great prostitute" of Revelation 17; that empire fell.
"The beast" may have stood for the emperor Domitian, or the structures of the empire; where are they now?
</p>

<p>
So, in 11 days' time, let's prayerfully cast our votes. And let's pray that God will give this nation of ours a government that will respect his values and do his will.
