<h4>
  We believe...

  <p>
  God made a great and glorious world to enjoy and use wisely. 
  We are made by him and our hearts are restless without him, 
  but have turned our backs on him.

<h4>
  We believe...
</h4>

  <p>
  That God did not look at our problems from a distance, 
  but loved us enough to become one of us in his Son Jesus Christ.
  He died on the cross for our sins and conquered evil He holds 
  open the door to eternal life to all who turn to him.
  </p>

<h4>
  We believe...
</h4>

  <p>
  That the Holy Spirit is at work making Jesus real today and so helping
  us to believe.
  </p>


<h4>
  We believe...
</h4>
	
  <p>
  That the Bible speaks clearly and powerfully to our world today.
