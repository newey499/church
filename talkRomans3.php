  <h4>Why We Are All In The Same Boat - Romans 2</h4>
</p>


<p>
The Word Gospel literally means Good News. This is a
translation from Greek. Similarly the English word
Gospel is derived from two Anglo-Saxon words meaning
good story. However whilst the Gospel is undoubtedly
good new Paul begins his letter to the Romans with bad
news. If you look in 1 verse 18 you read the wrath of
God is being revealed from heaven against all
Godlessness and wickedness of men?.
</p>

<p>
For Paul the starting point for our relationship with
God is one of alienation. God is rightly angry with
our sin. We are his enemies not his friends. Paul
begins with the idea that it is self evident from
creation that there must be an all powerful all mighty
creator. As a consequence we are without excuse for
failing to believe in him or follow him, and so (1
verse 32) we deserve death.
</p>

<p>
That may sound very stark, shocking, frightening or
offensive to us. If so it probably would have done to
those who first heard it. The Gospel of Jesus Christ
is a radical message that claims that  Jesus is the
sole way of getting to God. In doing so it disproves,
demolishes and exposes all other approaches as at best
inadequate,  and at worst there demonic, dangerous and
evil.
</p>

<p>
I recently went to another Church to worship. After
the service I noticed  that the servicehad  neither
begun with nor did it included at any point a
confession. As I though about I wondered was that just
an oversight or did it reveal a deeper problem, namely
that the people planning the service didn't really
have a biblical and Christian view of humanity. Did
they really believe that God was angry with sin and
that it was a problem that had to be dealt with?
</p>

<p>
Last week we were looking at Romans Chapter One. After
the Service someone told me the story of a Somali
Muslim man who came into a Christian meeting and
announced that he had become a Christian. People asked
why and he said &quot;I have read this book its all about
me.&quot; The book he had actually been reading was Romans
Chapter One. As he read he found that it was an
accurate description of his sinful state and that God
provided the answer to that in Jesus Christ.
Now as much as then, the fact of sin is a problem that
sometimes people don't want to accept. Having
described the depths of human sin Paul now deals with
some objections that people may have to the Gospel. He
goes on to show why we are all in the same boat and
all without exception sees us facing God's wrath.
Chapter Two deals with two kinds of people. First
verses 1 to 16 the moral Gentile and then verses 17 to
31 the Jew. Now you might make a parallel and call the
first a generally non religious person and the second
the overtly religious person.
</p>

<p>
<b>
The Moral Gentile verses 1 to 16.
</b>
<br />
<br />
In Chapter One of Romans we have a description of
people who blatantly breaks God's Law and do their own
way. Here, in this Chapter, the rebellion against God
is more subtle and may be much nearer to home. The
person described here is one who perhaps is not
generally and obviously breaking the Law of God (ie:
The Ten Commandments). It is someone who has a strong
sense of right and wrong. Not all the people of Paul's
time were wildly immoral as described in Chapter One.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes in the Book of Acts we meet people described
as God fearers. Not all may clearly identified with
the God of the Bible, but some would.  Greek history
was full of famous philosophers who were concerned
about right and wrong,  and by the  meaning of life.
This is not just the case in the first century, there
are many people like that today. If we think about
some of the big issues that stir people we see many
people who are concerned about justice. We can see
this for instance in people concerned in animal
rights, people who campaign for fair trade and debt
relief, the hard working politician passionately
concerned to impress minorities, etc. Equally close to
home we may good nieghours who look after the elderly
and involved in the community or deeply concerned
about some community issue such as vandalism.
</p>

<p>
Many years ago I worked in Belgium reaching out to
Students. One Student who I visited was a very clear
atheist we also had a very great love for plants.
Following a conversation I had with him one evening he
invited me to take some home. He immediately filled a
large box full of roots and shoots and helped me to
carry it downstairs and fix it onto my bicycle. He was
a very good and generous person. Yet he to needed the
Gospel.
</p>

<p>
If such a person were to look at their behaviour in
the light of that described at the end of Romans
Chapter One (eg: verses 29 to 31) they might think how
terrible is the behaviour of other people. They might
think I don't do things like that. But Paul turns the
finger round and says &quot;if you judge and by implication
think ourselves purer and holier than  others,
actually you are condemning yourself because you too
do the same things.&quot; I am not saying that literally do
the same things but in the general sense that we all
sin too.
</p>

<p>
The problem with these people is not that they were
rebels against God, but rather ironically they
identified themselves to closely with God. So much so
that they might have thought themselves as God's
allies and as such that he had nothing but compliments
for them. It is if unconsciously they have built
little religious platforms to look down on others.
Even if they are not as high as God they certainly are
not as low as many other people! If we look a Chapter
Two verse one we see that the problem is they act as
judges over others. However judgment is something
reserved for God alone.  The attitude here we do what
is right and you do what is wrong,
This is a mistake because God's judgment is first of
all based on truth. He sees people absolutely for what
they are. He sees right into the hearts and minds of
everyone. As a consequence we are foolish to imagine
that we can pass judgment on others and yet escape
judgment ourselves. How dare we stand alongside God as
judge.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we harden our hearts to God's conviction,
but we see (verse 4) it is out of God's kindness that
he convicts us and leads us to repentance. Moral
people are sometimes good amateur theologians and use
theological arguments against God's judgment. We argue
that God is too kind and too compassionate to judge
especially people like ourselves who are "good."
</p>

<p>
The problem of course is by what standard do we judge
people by? Ultimately it is by God's standards which
are perfect. God's kindness (verse 4) does not lead
him to say &quot;ok lets forget about sin it doesn't
matter.&quot; On the contrary, there is no forgiveness
without owning up in confession and repentance. If we
stubbornly refuse to admit we are in the same boat we
are simply building up God's wrath (verse 5). That may
seem very hard. We all probably know many &quot;good
people&quot; who do not profess any Christian faith. Are
they really facing God's wrath is they do not repent?
The answer is yes, God is fair. If you look at verse 6
we read &quot;he will give to each person according to what
he has done.&quot; In other words God is fair, he knows
everything, is perfectly good and thus able to be
absolutely fair and just. To those who are good he
grants eternal life (verse 7) on the other hand (verse
8) to those who do not do good there will be wrath and
anger. Where does the good moral person stand here?
They may not think they are very self seeking, but
God's standard is perfect. He is absolutely Holy. Have
they never been self seeking at all? Did they never do
a good deed and think I hope someone sees that, or
when we have done good deeds have we never sat back a
lapped up peoples praise and thought didn't I do well?
All goodness comes from God the honour and glory is
his alone.
</p>

<p>
This is the problem. We cut God out of the picture.
We can reject the truth without actively
denying it as is seen in the sort of militant atheism
of people like Richard Dawkins. However that is not
what most people do. Alternatively we can reject the
truth by simply quietly day be day ignoring it. Say
nothing and get on with everyone. However it is just
as bad for it fails to give God the glory due to his
name. Imagine for a minute some great sporting event.
A team wins a major football cup and they go home to a
victory parade. Imagine if they got home and the
President of the country or the Mayor of the town said
to the team &quot;only players who scored goals will be
allowed to take part in the victory parade.&quot; And then
he insisted he himself must stand at the front of the
open top bus and all the players must stand at the
back or go downstairs. He will be claiming the players
glory and suppressing the truth.  It would be
outrageous. However this is what we do when we claim
that the goodness of God comes from ourselves.
Just as God's salvation is for all so God's judgment
is for all both Jew and Gentile. Paul concludes in
verse 11 &quot;God does not show favouritism.&quot; Note that
Paul is not describing a sort of salvation by works
here. If he did so it is against all that he clearly
says elsewhere. Rather he is describing the general
principle by which God works and his justice. God is
fair and blesses what is good.
</p>

<p>
Now a moral person may sometimes take great pride in
knowing what is right and wrong and indeed in letting
others know. At least some people who claim to be
Christians, and maybe even are Christians sometimes do
an awful lot of this. But we read in verse 13 &quot;it is
not those who hear the Law who declared righteous in
God's sight but it is those who obey the Law who will
be declared righteous.&quot; Even those who have never had
the privilege of the Ten Commandments know what is
right and wrong. No one is without excuse.
</p>

<p>
<b>
The Religious Jew ? verses 17 to 29.
</b>
<br />
<br />
Paul moves onto a second group of people who may think
that Paul's devastating assessment of human kind does
not apply to them. In this particular situation that
was the Jewish people. If we wanted a parallel today
that of course may include Jewish people but it might
include any deeply religious people as well.
</p>

<p>
Paul anticipates two objections that these people may
have to the Gospel. They are two physical defenses.
The Jewish people were entrusted with the Law and were
rightly proud of it (verse 17). However it is one
thing to have Law and quite another think to live it.
We can see this in verse 21 &quot;You yourself then who
teach others do you not teach yourself? You preach
against stealing do you steal? You say people should
not commit adultery do you commit adultery? You who
abhor idols do you not rob temples?&quot; You might put it
this way today, do you walk the walk?
</p>

<p>
Now when we read these things it may not have been
true of the typical Jew of the time. Many were very
moral people. Probably would not generally committed
adultery, stole or been Temple robbers. Outwardly they
may have seemed much more moral than their neighbours.
Question is though how deep does the Law go? If we
look in the Sermon on the Mount we see how Jesus
redefines murder and adultery. Simply to be angry
(without cause) is to murder or to look lustfully is
to commit adultery.
</p>

<p>
The gap between knowing God's will and doing it has
always been a temptation for religious people. One of
the best sellers of the middle ages (and indeed of all
times) is a book called &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by
Thomas  a Kempis. He wrote about this problem &quot;of what
use is it to discourse learnedly on the Trinity if you
lack humility and therefore displease the Trinity.
Lofty words do not make a man holy, but a good life
makes him dear to God. I would rather fell contrition
than be able to define it. On the day of judgment we
will not be asked what have we read but what have we
done. Not how eloquently have we spoken but how holy
have we lived.&quot; (Book 1 Chapters 1 and 3).
</p>

<p>
This is our
problem we do not do what we know we should do.
Another way people try to make themselves righteous or
to deny the need of the Gospel is through religious
activity. We see in verse 25 that all male Jews were
required to be circumcised. It was a badge that said
they belonged to God. As a badge it only had value in
as much as it was a reminder. It was like wearing a
cross and having a fish sign on your car or a prayer
on the wall of your kitchen. Fine but does your life
or your driving or your cooking match it?
</p>

<p>
God looks on the heart. We read in verses 28 and 29 &quot;A
man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly nor is
circumcision merely outward and physical. No a man is
a Jew if he is one inwardly, and circumcision is
circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Everyone needs the Gospel. Don't let the devil fool
you into thinking that some people are so nice they
don't need to hear. Perhaps for those who have no
obvious sins we should pray for them even more. When
we share the Gospel with people please remember that
God does not show favouritism. Everyone stands under
the wrath of God and is in need of salvation.
</p>

<p>
What is that Salvation? What hope is there for us?
Robert Murray McCheyne was a Church of Scotland
Minister in Dundee. He died in 1843 aged just 30. He
was very much a man of prayer and a very powerful
Preacher. Outwardly he looked like the epitome of a
Saint. One Sunday morning a woman shook his hand at
the Church door and said &quot;O Mr, McCheyne you're a
saint.&quot; His reply was &quot;lady if you could look into my
heart you would spit in my face!&quot; He knew his
worthiness before God had nothing to do with his
saintliness but everything to do with his Saviour.
That is the hope that is for all of us. Let us look
less at ourselves and more of Jesus.
