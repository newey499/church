<b>The problem</b> with most non commercial websites is twofold.

</p>
<p>
Initially, the project commences with 
enthusiasm and the website scrupulously maintained to ensure its accuracy. After a while the 
initial enthusiasm dies and the website is not maintained, or the person with the technical skills required
disappears. 
</p>
<p>
Secondly, most websites are built as static sites that provide little if any interaction with the site visitor.
Worse, maintaining such sites requires a working knowledge of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).
</p>
<p>
Both of these problems tend to lead to the information on the website gradually becoming out of date. In many ways
an inaccurate website is worse than no website at all.
</p>
<p>
<b>The solution</b> is to design the website in such a way as to enable the contents of the website to be kept
upto date by anyone with access to the internet. The only technical ability required should be the ability to 
use a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape et al.
</p>
<p>
This prototype achieves this by storing the information displayed on the website in a database. Various 
web pages are provided in a password protected area of the website. These pages provide the ability 
to add/amend/delete the information displayed on the website.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the layout/appearance of the website will remain static and require some technical skill to alter, but
the information displayed by the website is configurable by anyone. Technical knowledge is not required. This
means that if the maintainer of the website is unable to continue, potential replacements 
are not limited to those with technical skills.
