	<h2>{$title}</h2>

<p>
This routine renumbers menu groups and items within groups.
<br />
It is disabled because the web site now uses internal links that should use
the primary key as the identifier of the page to load.
<br />
Need to check to make sure none of these internal links are relying upon
group and item numbers.
